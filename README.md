# KG20C: A scholarly knowledge graph benchmark dataset
KG20C is a curated knowledge graph built from the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) to support research on scholarly metadata â€” such as authors, papers, venues, affiliations, and citations. It has been designed for reproducible benchmarking in tasks including link prediction, recommendation, and question answering on scholarly data.

Note: This repository provides the dataset files and basic usage instructions.
A complete description of the dataset construction, schema, and evaluation baselines will appear in our forthcoming peer-reviewed publication.

## Dataset contents
### File format
All files are in tab-separated-values format, compatible with other popular benchmark datasets including WN18RR and FB15K-237. For example, *train.txt* includes "*28674CFA	author_in_affiliation	075CFC38*", which denotes the author with id *28674CFA* works in the affiliation with id *075CFC38*. 

The repo includes these files:
- *all_entity_info.txt* contains *id  name  type* of all entities
- *all_relation_info.txt* contains *id* of all relations
- *train.txt* contains training triples of the form *entity_1_id  relation_id  entity_2_id*
- *valid.txt* contains validation triples
- *test.txt* contains test triples
